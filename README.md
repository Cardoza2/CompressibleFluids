# CompressibleFluids.jl
An implementation of compressible fluid dynamics equations found in the text Gas Dynamics 3rd edition by John and Keith. 

I wrote this package as I took the class ME 510 Compressible Fluid Dynamics at Brigham Young University. It mainly contains implementations of that govern isentropic compressible fluid flow, but also have some functions on Fanno flow and Rayleigh flow. The isentropic functions include simple functions to replace the dreaded compressible fluid lookup tables and shockwave calculations. I added some simple geometric functions as well, to simplify supersonic airfoil analysis.
